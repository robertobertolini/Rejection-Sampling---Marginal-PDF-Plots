# Rejection-Sampling---Marginal-PDF-Plots

This code was developed to complete a homework assignment for a Bayesian modeling course (BEE 569) at Stony Brook University during the fall 2020 semester. 

Rejection sampling is used to sample points from three prespecified probability distributions:

Case #1 - (X,Y) are uniformly distributed on the square: -6≤X≤6; -6≤Y≤6

Case #2 - (X,Y) are uniformly distributed on the triangle: Y≤X≤6; -6≤Y≤X

Case #3 - (X,Y) are uniformly distributed on the circle: X^2+Y^2≤ 36
The marginal probability density functions (PDFs) are then plotted in R.
